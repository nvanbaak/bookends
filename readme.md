# Bookends: Make Chrome window navigation easier

## Introduction

Having difficulty navigating between eighteen windows of Google Chrome?  You're not alone.  So I came up with a quick solution.

## Usage

This is a drop-dead simple webpage with an input bar that changes its own tab name.  As long at this tab is active in a Chrome window, the tab name will be the text describing the whole window.  So give the tab a name that describes the rest of the tabs and pin it.  Once you train yourself to hit Ctrl-1 before you alt-tab away from the window, you'll be perfectly organized!

Unless you don't organize your tabs by window.  In that case, only God can help you.
